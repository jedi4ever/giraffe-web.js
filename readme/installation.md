a) Installing giraffe-web is easy. You can install it like any other npm module

`npm install - giraffe-web`

b) For your convenience we provide a `bashpack` allowing you to run it without having node installed.

Download it for your platform:

- [graphite-web-darwin-x64.run](https://github.com/jedi4ever/giraffe-web.js/raw/master/dist/giraffe-web-darwin-x64.run)
- [graphite-web-linux-x64.run](https://github.com/jedi4ever/giraffe-web.js/raw/master/dist/giraffe-web-linux-x64.run)

Note: [Bashpacks](http://github.com/jedi4ever/bashpack) are nodejs applications wrapped in a simple shell-executable.
