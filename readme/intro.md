[Giraffe](https://github.com/kenhub/giraffe) is an awesome dashboard for [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/)

Big Kudos to [@kenhub](https://github.com/kenhub)

This project :
- merely extends it into **a webserver**
- allows you to **specify your own config file** without changing the Giraffe content
- allows you to **proxy requests** to an internal Graphite server
- provides a self executable version requiring nothing but bash to run it
